# Clonoleaf:
This project represents my take on the Nanoleaf setups.

The modules I have designed, and used are much smaller in size though. What makes this different, is that I plan on adding other shapes asw well... depending on how they work out though. Multiple shapes will allow creating more versatile patterns. Triangle like modules are the very next design coming up, although I must need to standardize the size!

I will try to make the editable fusion360 file(s) later on.

## Code:
The code for driving the LEDs is for the ESP-12S module! I am using the familiar Arduino core for programming it. So getting it ported will be relatively easy. Find it in the "code" directory. Use platformIO or the arduino IDE, whichever helps!
The WS2812FX library has been used. I hope to keep the effects stock, as provided by its creator. Custom stuff will come later...

### More changes to code coming soon. Pull requests and suggestions are always welcome!
